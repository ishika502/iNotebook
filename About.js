        The iNotebook app can help you ensure you never forget a flash of
        creative inspiration. Writing things down on paper is all well and good,
        but we find it's very easy to lose our notes that way. But storing your
        thoughts, ideas and concepts electronically keeps them safe, secure and,
        best of all, searchable so that you can find them quickly when you need
        to.
      </p>
      <p className="container mx-1">
        A pioneer in the field, founded in 2000, iNotebook remains the cream of
        the best note-taking apps today. Working across all major platforms,
        this is the app we’d recommend for anyone looking to get started. Why?
        Because it’s got a good, capable free version, you can access your notes
        practically anywhere (laptop, desktop computer, tablet, or phone), and
        the app's packed with useful features.
